# shinyML


  Implement in one line of code a shareable web app to compare supervised machine learning regression models!
<p align="center">
  <img src="vignettes/shinyML.png">
</p>

  With `shinyML`, you can compare your favorite regression models issued from H2O or Spark frameworks without any effort. 



### Installation


  You can install the latest development version from github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("JeanBertinR/shinyML", ref="develop")
```

### Getting started: create the shinyML web app in just one list of code

  This is a basic example which shows you how to run the app:

```{r example, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width=600, out.height=400}

library(shinyML)
longley2 <- longley %>% mutate(Year = as.Date(as.character(Year),format = "%Y"))
shiny_h2o(data =longley2,x = c("GNP_deflator","Unemployed" ,"Armed_Forces","Employed"),y = "GNP",date_column = "Year",share_app = TRUE,port = 3951)
```


### Test different machine learning techiques and hyper-parameters configurations with just a few clicks

  First step consist in choosing separating train and test period from your dataset: this can be done in one second using slider button on the right of your shinyML app. 
  You can also remove variables from your initial selection directly from app just simply using "Input variable" textbox. 
You are then free to select hyper-parameters configuration for your favorite machine learning model.  
Note that hidden layers of deep learning technique can be set inside the corresponding text box: the default c(200,200) configuration corresponds to a two hiden-layers neural network, with neurons for each layers.

### Run at the same time all machine learning techniques to compare variable importances and error metrics

 You can easily use `shinyML` package to compare the four machine learning techniques with your own hyper-parameters configuration. 
For that, you will just need to use shiny app buttons corresponding to your parameters and click then to "Run tuned models !"

</center>

  You will see a validation message box once all models have been trained: at that point, you can have an overview of your results comparing variables importances and error metrics like MAPE  or RMSE.

### Run autoML alogrithm to find automatically configure the best machine learning regression model associated to your dataset 

  `AutoML` algorithm will automatically find the best algorithm to suit your regression task: the user will be informed of the machine learning technique used and know which hyper-parameters should be configured. 

  The only setting that must be adjusted by the user is the maximum time authorized for searching.
